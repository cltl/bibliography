  title={The role of knowledge in determining identity of long-tail entities},
  abstract={Identifying entities in text is an important step of semantic analysis. Some entity mentions comprise a name or description, but many include no information that identifies them in the system’s knowledge resources, which means that their identity cannot be established through traditional disambiguation. Consequently, such NIL (not in lexicon) entities have received little attention in entity linking systems and tasks so far. However, given the non-redundancy of knowledge on NIL entities, their lack of frequency priors, their potentially extreme ambiguity, and their numerousness, they constitute an important class of long-tail entities and pose a great challenge for state-of-the-art systems. In this paper, we describe a method for imputing identifying knowledge to NILs from generalized characteristics. We enrich the locally extracted information with profile models that rely on background knowledge in Wikidata. We describe and implement two profiling machines using state-of-the-art neural models. We evaluate their intrinsic behavior and their impact on the task of determining the identity of NIL entities.},

  title={Large-scale Cross-lingual Language Resources for Referencing and Framing},
  abstract={In this article, we lay out the basic ideas and principles of the project Framing Situations in the Dutch Language. We provide our first results of data acquisition, together with the first data release. We introduce the notion of cross-lingual referential corpora. These corpora consist of texts that make reference to exactly the same incidents. The referential grounding allows us to analyze the framing of these incidents in different languages and across different texts. During the project, we will use the automatically generated data to study linguistic framing as a phenomenon, build framing resources such as lexicons and corpora. We expect to capture larger variation in framing compared to traditional approaches for building such resources. Our first data release, which contains structured data about a large number of incidents and reference texts, can be found at http://dutchframenet.nl/data-releases/.},

  abstract= {With more agents deployed than ever, users need to be able to interact and cooperate with them in an effective and comfortable manner. Explanations have been shown to increase the understanding and trust of a user in human- agent interaction. There have been numerous studies investigating this effect, but they rely on the user explicitly requesting an explanation. We propose a first overview of when an explanation should be triggered and show that there are many instances that would be missed if the agent solely relies on direct questions. For this, we differentiate between direct triggers such as commands or questions and intro- duce indirect triggers like confusion or uncertainty detection.},

In this paper, we investigate such sequential cross-modal alignment by modelling the image description generation process computationally. We take as our starting point a state-of-the-art image captioning system and develop several model variants that exploit information from human gaze patterns recorded during language production. In particular, we propose the first approach to image description generation where visual processing is modelled sequentially. Our experiments and analyses confirm that better descriptions can be obtained by exploiting gaze-driven attention and shed light on human cognitive processes by comparing different ways of aligning the gaze modality with language production. We find that processing gaze data sequentially leads to descriptions that are better aligned to those produced by speakers, more diverse, and more natural---particularly when gaze is encoded with a dedicated recurrent component.",  author    = "Ece Takmaz and Sandro Pezzelle and Lisa Beinborn and Raquel Fern{\'a}ndez",  year      = "2020",  month     = nov,  day       = "1",  doi       = "10.18653/v1/2020.emnlp-main.377",  language  = "English",  pages     = "4664--4677",  booktitle = "Proceedings of the 2020 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP)",  publisher = "Association for Computational Linguistics", }

In this article, we look beyond engineering goals and analyze the relations between languages in computational representations. We introduce a methodology for comparing languages based on their organization of semantic concepts. We propose to conduct an adapted version of representational similarity analysis of a selected set of concepts in computational multilingual representations. Using this analysis method, we can reconstruct a phylogenetic tree that closely resembles those assumed by linguistic experts. These results indicate that multilingual distri-butional representations that are only trained on monolingual text and bilingual dictionaries preserve relations between languages without the need for any etymological information. In addition, we propose a measure to identify semantic drift between language families. We perform experiments on word-based and sentence-based multilingual models and provide both quantitative results and qualitative examples. Analyses of semantic drift in multilingual representations can serve two purposes: They can indicate unwanted characteristics of the computational models and they provide a quantitative means to study linguistic phenomena across languages.",  author    = "Lisa Beinborn and Rochelle Choenni",  year      = "2020",  month     = sep,  doi       = "10.1162/COLI_a_00382",  language  = "English",  volume    = "46",  pages     = "571--603",  journal   = "Computational Linguistics",  issn      = "0891-2017",  publisher = "MIT Press Journals",  number    = "3", }

	Abstract = {In this paper we describe a method to detect event descriptions in different news articles and to model the semantics of events and their components using RDF representations. We compare these descriptions to solve a cross-document event coreference task. Our com- ponent approach to event semantics defines identity and granularity of events at different levels. It performs close to state-of-the-art approaches on the cross-document event coreference task, while outperforming other works when assuming similar quality of event detection. We demonstrate how granularity and identity are interconnected and we discuss how se- mantic anomaly could be used to define differences between coreference, subevent and topical relations.},

	Abstract = {Image description datasets, such as Flickr30K and MS COCO, show a high degree of variation in the ways that crowd-workers talk about the world. Although this gives us a rich and diverse collection of data to work with, it also introduces uncertainty about how the world should be described. This paper shows the extent of this uncertainty in the PEOPLE-domain. We present a taxonomy of different ways to talk about other people. This taxonomy serves as a reference point to think about how other people should be described, and can be used to classify and compute statistics about labels applied to people.},

We present a robot that models relativity of knowledge and perception within social interaction following principles of the theory of mind. We utilized vision and speech capabilities on a Pepper robot to build an interaction model that stores the interpretations of perceptions and conversations in combination with provenance on its sources. The robot learns directly from what people tell it, possibly in relation to its perception. We demonstrate how the robot's communication is driven by hunger to acquire more knowledge from and on people and objects, to resolve uncertainties and conflicts, and to share awareness of the perceived environment. Likewise, the robot can make reference to the world and its knowledge about the world and the encounters with people that yielded this knowledge.},

We report on the current methods to create event reference data by annotating texts and deriving the event data a posteriori. Our method starts from event registries in which event data is defined a priori. From this data, we extract so-called Microworlds of referential data with the Reference Texts that report on these events. This makes it possible to easily establish referential relations with high precision and at a large scale. In a pilot, we successfully obtained data from these resources with extreme ambiguity and variation, while maintaining the identity and reference relations and without having to annotate large quantities of texts word-by-word. The data from this pilot was annotated using an annotation tool created specifically in order to validate our method and to enrich the reference texts with event coreference annotations. This annotation process resulted in the Gun Violence Corpus, whose development process and outcome are described in this paper.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we present ReferenceNet: a semantic-pragmatic network of reference relations between synsets. Synonyms are assumed to be exchangeable in similar contexts and also word embeddings are based on sharing of local contexts represented as vectors.
Co-referring words, however, tend to occur in the same topical context but in different local contexts. In addition, they may express different concepts related through topical coherence, and through author framing and perspective. In this paper, we describe how reference relations can be added to WordNet and how they can be acquired. We evaluate two methods of extracting event coreference relations using WordNet relations against a manual annotation of 38 documents within the same topical domain of gun violence. We conclude that precision is reasonable but recall is lower because the WordNet hierarchy does not sufficiently capture the required coherence and perspective relations.},

	Abstract = {Error propagation is a common problem in NLP. Reinforcement learning explores erroneous states during training and can therefore be more robust when mistakes are made early in a process. In this paper, we apply reinforcement learning to greedy dependency parsing which is known to suffer from error propagation. Reinforcement learning improves accuracy of both labeled and unlabeled dependencies of the Stanford Neural Dependency Parser, a high performance greedy parser, while maintaining its efficiency. We investigate the portion of errors which are the result of error propagation and confirm that reinforcement learning reduces the occurrence of error propagation.},

	Abstract = {We present extensive evaluations comparing the performance of taxonomy-based and corpus-based approaches on SimLex- 999. The results confirm our hypothesis that taxonomy-based approaches are more suitable to identify similarity. We introduce two new measures of evaluation that show that all measures perform well on a coarse-grained evaluation and that it is not always clear which approach is most suitable when a similarity score is used as a threshold. This leads us to conclude that the inferior performance of corpus-based approaches may not (always) matter.},
